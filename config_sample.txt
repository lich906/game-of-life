#         ________     This is a sample config file for "Game of Life v0.3"    _________
#              Exectable reads configuration info from "config.txt" from the directory 
#         where .exe is placed. File "config_sample.txt" represents sample of content of
#         config file. It contains all available config variables with its default
#         values assigned to them.
#
#              You can rename "config_sample.txt" file to "config.txt" and use it.
#
#              If config file does not contain one of available variables then default
#         value is used. Variable names are case sensitive. Numeric values are only
#         positive integers.
#              
#              Basic syntax: <variable name>=<value>
#              "#" symbol describes comment line
